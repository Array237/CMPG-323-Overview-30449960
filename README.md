# Branching startegy to be used
I will use multiple branches to work on my projects. I will have the main branch where my final code will be stored. I will have an develop branch where I would make changes to my code from main branch, see how it affects my other code and once i'm satisifeid I will merge it with the main branch. I will also consider using additional branches on the develop branch when I need to experiment on the develop branch.

# Use of .gitignore
<p>I will use .gitignore file to indicate which files/folders to ignore and will be unique to each project I will be submitting this semester</p>

# Storage of Credentials
To store valuable information that i only want certain people to have access too, I will use GitHubs encrypted secrets. I will create the secrets on an organizational level so that more than one of my repositories that i have created has access to the same secret if neccesarry.
